Libusbg testing guideline
-------------------------

Libusbg tests use cmocka library to simulate fake configfs filesystem,
by wrapping input/output functions.

## Building and running tests

# Requirements
Building libusbg tests requires cmocka library.

# Building
In order to build tests run inside 'tests' directory:

	$ make

# Running
After successfull compilation you can run all defined test cases:

	$ ./test.sh

This should produce report on standart output. It contains list of all
test cases and its status - OK or FAILED. At the end of report number of
passed/failed tests is written and then all failed test cases are listed.

It's also possible to pass custom configuration file to testing environment.
Currently it's used only for skipping tests. Use --generate-config and
--use-config options of test.sh to generate default config and read config
from file. Run ./test.sh --help for more help.

# Tests skipping
When you want to skip a test case, generate config file by --generate-config option,
delete test from generated file and use it by --use-config option.


## Writting tests

Before starting your own tests implementation, become familiar with cmocka
library (cmocka.org).

test.c file contains tests implementation. Test cases are stored in
UnitTest structures (from cmocka) and run by run_tests macro.

In cmocka each test case can be composed of three parts: setup, test and
teardown.

# Setup functions
In setup input data must be initialized and assigned to pointer given as
argument.

Libusbg requires initialized usbg_state structure for most of it's api
functions. In most cases we define initial state in test_* strutures and
pass it to test function, in order to run usbg_init. Each test_state
can be defined quite simply by listing gadgets, its configs and functions
(using gcc extenstion), e.g.:

	static struct test_state simple_state = {
		.path = "config",
		.gadgets = simple_gadgets,
		.udcs = simple_udcs
	};

test_state structure (or other structure, if neccessary for test case)
is casted to void * in setup function. Note, that when using test_state
you must sort its content and fill additional fields (i.e. pathes strings).
It can be done by calling prepare_state before test.

# Test functions
Test functions contain libusbg functions calls, preparations for them and
checking results.

When calling usbg function which operates on filesystem proper preparation
is needed. Usbg-test framework provides functions which tell cmocka what
operations are expected from corresponding usbg function (push_* and pull_*
functions).

E.g., in most cases you want correctly initialized usbg_state. It can be done
by preparing filesystem by push_init and running usbg_init after that:

	push_init(in);
	usbg_ret = usbg_init(in->path, out);

init_with_state function does that and checks results.

When tested usbg function was run, you can check results by cmocka assert
macros. Usbg-test also provides set of assert functions for usbg structures.

# Teardown functions
When test was run, you can define teardown function, which can do the cleanup.
Argument is passed same way as before, by assigning it to cmocka state pointer
in test function and receiving it in teardown function.

In most cases you will just want to cleanup after initializing state and running
some usbg functions. To do that teardown_state can be used as teardown function.
You can write custom teardown for other cases.

Note that in preparation for test some memory is allocated. All allocated
pointers are stored on global stack and should be freed by calling cleanup_stack
after test is finished (in teardown function).

Remember that teardown is called also when test failed. You should assign
something correct (NULL for example) for your teardown function to test
argument before running functions which may fail.

# Composing test cases
All test cases are defined in list of UnitTest structures. You can define test
case by macros provided by cmocka or by USBG_TEST macro.

USBG_TEST is similar to unit_test_setup_teardown from cmocka, but always uses
the same teardown (teardown_state) and names test case with custom string.
It combines setup function with test function, so one test function can be
run with many different states.

# Documenting test cases
For tests documentation few doxygen macros are created.
\usbg_test indicates that current comment block contains test case documentation.
\test_desc{name, description, function} describe test with its name, function
which is tested and short descripttion of what this test does.

# Adding tests
Simplest way to add more tests is defining test states and new setup functions,
combining them with existing testing functions using USBG_TEST. You can also
write own test function. When you have test and setup prepared, add

	USBG_TEST("test_name", test_function, setup_function),

at the end of tests[] array in main. Remember to add documentation to the case
(see Documenting test cases).

# Removing tests
In order to remove test case just delete corresponding element on tests[] list
(including documentation above it).

# Modyfing tests
When you want to change data using in test case, change corresponding test_*
structures. Note, that single test state can be used in many test cases and
modyfing it can effect them as well.
You can also change test logic (by modifying test function used in case), as
long as you know what you're doing.


## Final notes

Remember, that in test environment functions operating on files are replaced
and operations on files cannot be performed. However, using standard input/output
is possible.

All test cases are run in single thread, so some failures on one test case
(e.g. SIGSEGV) can cause crash on whole tests set.
